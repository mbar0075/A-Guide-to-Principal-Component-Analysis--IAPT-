## Description of Task:
**Principal component analysis (PCA)** is an incredibly useful, and widely used multivariate algorithm in Machine Learning. Moreover, such algorithm is also extremely helpful in the analysis of huge datasets, whilst effectively undertaking dimensionality reduction and feature selection.

Nevertheless, such algorithm’s behaviour may not always be comprehensible, thus triggering the need for the development of avisual tool, which allow users the possibility of visualising the algorithm’s stages and data transformations, whilst offering a better understanding on the modified data. Consequently, the programmed solution also effectively portrays the PCA process as a simple convenient methodology which may be explained to students who havejust completed a linear algebra or AI numerical methods course.

Additionally, the developed **Jupyter notebook** which outlines the aforementioned process, conveys to the students the necessary information to understand better such algorithm, whilst providing them with essential tools, to experiment and expand their knowledge. Furthermore, the notebook’s characteristics of being robust
and responsive, allow students to interact with the visual plots through the plot’s minimising and maximising tools. The Jupyter notebook which incorporates the developed solution, will be complemented with various famous datasets utilised by the machine learning community such as the Iris dataset, with the aim of making
the students familiar with such datasets. One must note that the datasets were chosen for their distinct properties, to allow students to evaluate different experiments and infer new knowledge.
